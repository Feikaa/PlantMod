# Feika's Plant Mod

This mod currently adds 5 new berries and 6 new mushrooms that generate around the world. It also adds a new use to cacti. If you shear a cacti, you'll get cactus needles, and the cactus will turn into a shaved cactus. You can use 4 cactus needles in a 2x2 square to craft a cactus arrowhead, which can be used as a substitute to flint when crafting an arrow. The shaved cactus can be turned into cactus flesh, which can be eaten raw, or cooked in a furnace to make cooked cactus flesh.
